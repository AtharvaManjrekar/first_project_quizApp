# first_project_quizApp
This is my first project using html , css , js. It is just a quiz app in which I have given 10 questions and the user have to give the correct answer. If the answer is correct it will give score.
This project is not fully complete i.e. dosent involve all the things such as Count of incorrect answer and ending of game.
I will surely update it further later!
